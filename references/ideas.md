### User can switch on/switch off the subtitles. Both of his recognized speech and the AI buddy.
### Different voices
It would be super cool to have conversations with different characters(voices). Perhaps it requires the use of more than one model to synthesise the voice.
### Collecting the user's data which is vital for the further tailored topics can be organized as part of the starting-to-speak process.
By providing brief answers about himself, the user lays the foundation for further discussion (topics) and fills it with sufficient details.
### Ways to store user's data are:
There are two different ways to store the user's data in vector form:
- Vector Databases:
* [ ] Weaviate (Open Source)
* [ ] Milvus (Open Source)
* [ ] Pinecone (Cloud Only)
* [ ] Chroma (Open Source)
* [ ] Qdrant (Open Source)
- Vector Library:
* [ ] FAISS (Open Source)

We should decide which one to choose according to data size and the processing speed. 
### Background sound would help to create the presence effect.
